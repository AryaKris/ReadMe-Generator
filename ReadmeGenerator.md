## Installation

 In this project we tried to execute a design integrating data received from two server-side API requests. We have used the National Park Service (NPS) API and Open Weather API to build this website. One of the major requirement of this project was to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. We have used Bulma as a framework API.
